                Hello dear guests of my website. I am a portrait, lifestyle, fashion and product
                photographer based in South West. To be exact I am located
                in Mesa,
                Arizona and available to travel. I create imagery that is filled with emotions and
                life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have been capturing moments since 2020 and nothing makes me happier than delivering
                results that exceed the expectations of my clients. I approach each photo session as an
                opportunity to document my clients in an honest way to preserve the moment. I find
                beauty in
                between moments and try to tell a story with my photographs to bring out the feelings
                that
                we sometimes forget. My goal is to capture timeless photos
                that
                you can look back on years down the road. I always get inspired by every day life,
                nature, people I come across, little
                imperfections
                and moments that people usually overlook.
            </p>
            <p>
                I grew up in Kyiv, Ukraine, but the last 10 years I spent exploaring the world with my
                husband Michael and our puppy girl.
                In November 2022 we have decided to extablish a permanent home and moved to Phoenix,
                Arizona where Michael was born and raised.
                I absolutely love the spirit of the people in America and the beauty of the nature that
                surrounds us here.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for considering me to be your photographer. Have a good morning, day or evening
                dear stranger.</p>
